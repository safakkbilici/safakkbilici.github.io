A Computer Engineer/Science student for three years at Yildiz Technical University. I am working on the field of Mathematics: Number Theory, Abstract Algebra, Mathematical Analysis, Linear Algebra, Statistics/Probability, Convex Optimization; and the field of Computer Science: Computer Vision, Image Processing, Natural Language Processing, Linux System Programming.
I really enjoy educating; I teach Machine Learning, C Programming and Python Programming at YTU SkyLab and YTU Data Science Community.
I'm also a pianist and a music composer for Jazz and Classical music, also a Music Theory instructor.
