------------------------
A pianist and Classical Music composer who is obsessed with atonality and microtonality.

And also a Computer Science student who is focused on Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, Bayesian Inference, Haskell.

I hate web development and Java. I hate minimalism, simplicity on music. I hate a lot of things but this is not the place.
