------------------------
A Classical Music composer who hates minimalism (wait, what? But this is a minimalist "about" page?) and loves atonality. 

And also a Computer Science student who loves Natural Language Processing, Bayesian Statistics and Haskell.

Pls listen my [compositions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFVua8j3Ssal2hSY4VXLj8g?view_as=subscriber).

Wow, you have a [Deep Learning lecture](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8kGuiVdKeKh31pVMF-ObZxu3C2E5A3Y7) in Turkish?
