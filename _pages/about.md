------------------------
I am a pianist and Classical Music composer who is obsessed with atonality and microtonality. I am also a Computer Science student who is focused on Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, Bayesian Inference and Haskell. I love everything about language, linguistics and probability.

I hate web development, Java and Windows OS. I hate minimalism and simplicity on music. I hate a lot of things but this is not the place.
