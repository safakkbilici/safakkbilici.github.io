### Şafak Bilici (sha-FUCK billie-G) (\[[ʃɑ.ˈfɑk](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CA%83%C9%91.%CB%88f%C9%91k&voice=Filiz)\] [[biɭiʤi](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=bi%C9%ADi%CA%A4i&voice=Filiz)\])

I did my BSc [@YTU](https://www.yildiz.edu.tr/en/) CS. I am currently working [@Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/en/) as Research Engineer, focusing on optimization of search engines. I was an undergraduate researcher [@Nova Research Lab.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/novaresearchlab/mycompany/) under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Dr. Fatih Amasyali during my bachelor. At Nova Lab., I mostly worked on intersection of variational inference and low-resource language models and published two conference papers. My BSc thesis was on multimodal transformers and [natural language grounding](https://katefvision.github.io/LanguageGrounding/), with applications on ranking/retrieval, visual question answering etc. I am also part of the [inzva](https://inzva.com/) team as AI Program Specialist.

I mostly work on low-resource language modeling, machine translation, representation learning, and bayesian machine learning. Besides that; I realy love population biology, language acquisition and biolinguistics.

I have been studying classical music theory for almost 10 years. I played keyboard and guitar in various bands with different styles (yes, Death Metal too). [I've been composing classical music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFVua8j3Ssal2hSY4VXLj8g) for almost 4 years. My main instrument is piano but my playing style is more like Jazz with atonality, free modality and eastern sounds, so I am cursed by conservative composers...

If you want to discuss the things that I mentioned above or anything else, buy me a coffee. My email address at bottom of the page. Damn I really love coffee.

I hate frontend development, Java and Windows OS. I hate minimalism and simplicity on music. I hate Largo tempo. I hate a lot of things but this is not the place.
