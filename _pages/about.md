------------------------
I am third year CS student [@Yildiz Technical University](https://www.yildiz.edu.tr/en/). I am a member of [@Nova Research Lab.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/novaresearchlab/mycompany/) under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Dr. Fatih Amasyali. My research interests are Natural Language Processing (any topic about Computational Linguistics!), Bayesian Machine Learning and Functional Programming (Haskell). I am also a pianist and Classical Music composer who is obsessed with atonality and microtonality. Even though it is not my major, conducting modern era Classical Music pieces is a passion for me.

I hate web development, Java and Windows OS. I hate minimalism and simplicity on music. I hate Largo tempo. I hate a lot of things but this is not the place.
