This section covers my favorite textbooks/papers, albums (and others) recommendations.

# Textbooks/Papers

- **Convex Optimization: Stephen Boyd, Lieven Vandenberghe**; good book for who studies deep learning. It covers convex sets, optimizers and its applications like approximation and fitting.

- **Digital Image Processing: Rafael C. Gonzalez**; this is the most important book in Digital Image Processing that I have read. It is a very good introduction for computer vision/image processing. It covers theory and applications of image filtering (spatial/frequency), restoration and reconstruction, transforms (wavelet etc), morphology, segmentation, classifiation etc.

- **Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning: David Barber**; very good introductory machine learning/graphical model book, but in probabilistic way. It is slightly unorthodox introduction to machine learning. Very good resource for who insterested in Bayesian Machine Learning and Bayesian Inference.

- **An Introduction to Statistical Learning With Applications in R: Robert Tibshirani (et al.)**; I started to learn Machine Learning with this book. It is a very good introduction for undergraduate CS students who already studied Statistics, Algorithms, Calculus, Linear Algebra. It gives examples/exercises in R Programming Language. I do not recommend exercises due to I am not a fan of R. The book covers traditional machine learning algorithms (regression, classification, clustering etc.) and its applications in real world datas.
