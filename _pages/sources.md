# Textbooks

- **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Christopher Bishop)**: I was recommended to read this book to gain more theoretical understanding for Bayesian Machine Learning by my friend Onur. Book is very hard to read, I am still reading it. It starts from meaning of Bayesian Inference and then continues from probability distributions section. Then introduces Bayesian techniques on Machine Learning. Also my friend Onur recommended that taking the "Bayesian Statistics" [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics) on Coursera will be a good preliminary for this book.

- **Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow et al.)**; I started to learn Deep Learning with this book. An excellent, comprehensive textbook on Deep Learning. But, strongly, I do not recommend this book for beginners in this field. It requires very good mathematics knowledge (Linear Algebra, Advanced Calculus, Statistics and Probability, Information Theory etc. etc.). Yes it covers some mathematical concepts in first chapters but still not enough. If you feel comfortable with deriving matrices, interpreting distribubtions and others. Go on my friend, read the "bible".

- **An Introduction to Statistical Learning With Applications in R (Robert Tibshirani et al.)**; I started to learn Machine Learning with this book. It is a very good introduction for undergraduate CS students who already studied Statistics, Algorithms, Calculus, Linear Algebra. It gives examples/exercises in R Programming Language. I do not recommend exercises due to I am not a fan of R. The book covers traditional machine learning algorithms (regression, classification, clustering etc.) and its applications in real world data.

- **Machine Learning (Ethem AlpaydÄ±n)**; Very good introduction for mathematical interpretation of Machine Learning. I always recommend this book for starters who wants to study this area. Simple language, easily understandable.

- **Speech and Language Processing (Dan Jurafsky)**: I recommend this book for starting Natural Language Processing. This book is important because this is not a Deep Learning book. This book will persuade you to love lingustics. Studying the book plus some Python exercises on web will help yo to gain NLP skills.

- **Convex Optimization (Stephen Boyd, Lieven Vandenberghe)**; good book for who studies deep learning. It covers convex sets, optimizers and its applications like approximation and fitting.

- **Digital Image Processing (Rafael C. Gonzalez)**; this is the most important book in Digital Image Processing that I have read. It is a very good introduction for computer vision/image processing. It covers theory and applications of image filtering (spatial/frequency), restoration and reconstruction, transforms (wavelet etc), morphology, segmentation, classifiation etc.

- **Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning (David Barber)**; very good introductory machine learning/graphical model book, but in probabilistic way. It is slightly unorthodox introduction to machine learning. Very good resource for who insterested in Bayesian Machine Learning and Bayesian Inference.
