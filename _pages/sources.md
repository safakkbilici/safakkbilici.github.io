This section covers my favorite textbook/paper, album (and others) recommendations.

# Textbook/Paper

- **Convex Optimization: Stephen Boyd, Lieven Vandenberghe**

Good book for who studies deep learning. It covers convex sets, optimizers and its applications like approximation and fitting.

- **Digital Image Processing: Rafael C. Gonzalez**

This is the most important book in Digital Image Processing that I have read. It is a very good introduction for computer vision/image processing. It covers theory and applications of image filtering (spatial/frequency), restoration and reconstruction, transforms (wavelet etc), morphology, segmentation, classifiation etc.
