This section covers my favorite resources.

# Textbooks

- **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Christopher Bishop)**: Of course not a book for learning Machine Learning. This book introduces probability distributions in detail. Most of the topics in machine learning are covered in fully Bayesian way. But the perspective of the book is not only Machine Learning. It is a good resource to learn graphical models, sampling methods.

- **Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow et al.)**; I started to learn Deep Learning with this book. An excellent, comprehensive textbook on Deep Learning. It requires very good mathematics knowledge (Linear Algebra, Advanced Calculus, Statistics and Probability, Information Theory etc. etc.). Yes it covers some mathematical concepts in first chapters but still not enough. If you feel comfortable with deriving matrices, interpreting distribubtions and others.

- **An Introduction to Statistical Learning With Applications in R (Robert Tibshirani et al.)**; I started to learn Machine Learning with this book. It is a very good introduction for undergraduate CS students who already studied Statistics, Algorithms, Calculus, Linear Algebra. It gives examples/exercises in R Programming Language, if you want to learn R, this is the book. The book covers traditional machine learning algorithms (regression, classification, clustering etc.) and its applications in real world data.

- **Machine Learning (Ethem AlpaydÄ±n)**; Very good introduction for mathematical interpretation of Machine Learning. I always recommend this book for starters who wants to study this area. Simple language, easily understandable.

- **Speech and Language Processing (Dan Jurafsky)**: I recommend this book for starting Natural Language Processing. This is one of the most comprehensive books about NLP. As you may know, in recent years Deep Learning era of Language Processing has been rising. This book also covers statistical & traditional methods in computational linguistics: from Hidden Markov Models to Combinatory Categorial Grammar.

- **Convex Optimization (Stephen Boyd, Lieven Vandenberghe)**; A good book for convex optimization algorithms. It gives more theoretical perspective while learning Deep Learning.

- **Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning (David Barber)**; very good introductory machine learning/graphical model book, but in probabilistic way. It is slightly unorthodox introduction to machine learning. Very good resource for who insterested in Bayesian Machine Learning and Bayesian Inference.
