## Theorem

This week the problem is one of the most beautiful proof that I have ever seen. There many proofs about this theorem, I will write here my favorite ones (in other words, I will write what I know).

Let $$x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_n \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$$. Then, GM (geometric mean) $$\leq$$ (Harmonic mean) $$\leq$$ AM (arithmetic mean), in mathematical notation:

$$ \frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + ... + \frac{1}{x_n}} \leq \sqrt[n]{x_1x_2...x_n} \leq \frac{x_1+x_2+...+x_n}{n}$$

, with equality in both cases if and only if all $$x_i$$â€™s are equal. Before we prove this, try to prove yourself.
