## The Problem
This is the start of "Weekly Problems". I will upload selected problems, that are my favorite ones (mostly about mathematics), to my blog.
So, this week's problem is:

*Sum of independent Gaussian random variables is Gaussian*

Text 3. *italics*

### Proof

What do I mean by independent? Why a must? Firstly let' say $$y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\sigma_1^2)$$

### H3 Heading

Text 3.

What about a [link][https://github.com/safakkbilici]

Bullets:

* item 1
+ item 2
- item 3

Numbers:

1. First
2. Second

Tex:

$$\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x}$$
