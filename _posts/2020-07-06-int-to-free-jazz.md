Free jazz is a sub-genre of jazz that is a uprising from the traditional modal jazz rules. Before we talk about free jazz, we should talk about the roots of traditional modal jazz. To speak in musical parlance, the word “mode” (lemmatization: modal -> mode) simply means “scale”; it is often used to describe a scale other than major or minor (i.e.; Chromatic Scale, Diminished Scale etc.).
