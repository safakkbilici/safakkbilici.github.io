Free jazz is a sub-genre of jazz that is a uprising from the traditional modal jazz rules. Before we talk about free jazz, we should talk about the roots of traditional modal jazz. To speak in musical parlance, the word “mode” (lemmatization: modal -> mode) simply means “scale”; it is often used to describe a scale other than major or minor (i.e.; Chromatic Scale, Diminished Scale etc.). In 20th and 21th century, major and minor scales derive from the “modes” of medieval music (modus). In the traditional system of eight modes (in 8th - 16th centuries) there are four pairs, each pair comprising an authentic mode and a plagal mode.

Given the confusion between ancient, medieval, and modern terminology, today it is more consistent and practical to use the traditional designation of the modes with numbers one to eight. But, for some stupid reason, jazz musicians are insistent in using Greek notation. Modes were used as a resource by some relatively modern classical composers like Claude Debussy and Béla Bartók, who felt the need to go beyond traditional major/minor tonality. In the 1950s, jazz musicians also began to work with modal approaches.

Actually; modal jazz, as the name implies, is a genre of Jazz that arose in the late 1950’s and uses ‘modality’ rather than ‘tonality’. Let's talk about the jazz musician Miles Davis, always a trend-setter in jazz (unfortunately).Miles’ modal work was preceded by a number of contributing influences. Or, George Russell’s "Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization" was a mode-based approach to music that influenced certain New York jazz musicians in the 1940s-1950s, notably Miles Davis, Bill Evans, and Gil Evans (both Bill Evans and Gil Evans worked with Miles Davis, and contributed to “Kind of Blue”, which is a bad album in my opinion).

Before we go for free jazz, let's talk about derivations of modal changes.

### Vertical versus Horizontal

Before Modal Jazz, composers/player generally thought ‘vertically’. By removing the ‘functionality’ of chords – modality allows a composer/player to focus exclusively on the melody and not worry about the underlying harmony. You focus on creating melodies in a particular scale or key. This is called thinking ‘horizontally’ (i.e. in terms of scales and melodies). However, modality treats the chords as ‘decorative’ rather than ‘functional’. This gives you greater flexibility when improvising and, in fact, forces you to focus on creating interesting melodies – and not about just outlining the chords or modifying the solo to fit the chord progression.

In Modal Jazz, you can:
- Target to any note in the scale.
- Start and finish a phrase whenever you like.
- Build and resolve tension whenever you like.
..in modal jazz the solo does **NOT** need to fit a particular chord progression, and instead must just be an interesting and unique melody.

But, even though a Modal Jazz solo is ‘freer’ than a tonal solo, there are, nevertheless, still some restrictions in modal improvisation. You should generally:
- Stick to the relevant scale/mode (with occasional chromatic passing notes).
- Avoid the diatonic tritone [1] (as it sounds tonal).
- Emphasise the root note in the bass.
- Emphasise the character tone [2] within the particular mode.
