Free jazz is a sub-genre of jazz that is a uprising from the traditional modal jazz rules. Before we talk about free jazz, we should talk about the roots of traditional modal jazz. To speak in musical parlance, the word “mode” (lemmatization: modal -> mode) simply means “scale”; it is often used to describe a scale other than major or minor (i.e.; Chromatic Scale, Diminished Scale etc.). In 20th and 21th century, major and minor scales derive from the “modes” of medieval music (modus). In the traditional system of eight modes (in 8th - 16th centuries) there are four pairs, each pair comprising an authentic mode and a plagal mode.

Given the confusion between ancient, medieval, and modern terminology, today it is more consistent and practical to use the traditional designation of the modes with numbers one to eight. But, for some stupid reason, jazz musicians are insistent in using Greek notation. Modes were used as a resource by some relatively modern classical composers like Claude Debussy and Béla Bartók, who felt the need to go beyond traditional major/minor tonality. In the 1950s, jazz musicians also began to work with modal approaches.
Actually; modal jazz, as the name implies, is a genre of Jazz that arose in the late 1950’s and uses ‘modality’ rather than ‘tonality’. Let's talk about the jazz musician Miles Davis, always a trend-setter in jazz (unfortunately).Miles’ modal work was preceded by a number of contributing influences. Or, George Russell’s "Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization" was a mode-based approach to music that influenced certain New York jazz musicians in the 1940s-1950s, notably Miles Davis, Bill Evans, and Gil Evans (both Bill Evans and Gil Evans worked with Miles Davis, and contributed to “Kind of Blue”, which is a bad album in my opinion).
