This post is my playground for prior distributions. Do not expect a formal post.

# Introduction

We would like to ask what is the probability of my parameter $$\theta$$'s true value is higher than 0.75?

In Bayesian Inference, parameters are not fixed constant as in classical statistical learning. We treat parameters as a random variable. This allows us to make probabilistic statements about the parameter values.
