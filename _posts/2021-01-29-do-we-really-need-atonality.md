# Introduction

{: .text-justify}
&nbsp; &nbsp; This post includes personal opinions on classical music, atonality & tonality, composition. Also includes formal informations about atonality theory and its history. Before starting to read, I strongly recommend you listen the most beautiful composition of Stravinsky: [Le Sacre du printemps](https://open.spotify.com/album/317b74rpNBO2uhaJFyMaxJ?si=Qm8WFADFRb6y6Ireoo24VQ). Leaving aside its historical development, atonality first manifested itself in the form of music in the early 1900s. I have described the lack of tonal music in my [Free Jazz post](https://safakkbilici.github.io/int-to-free-jazz/). But, free jazz and classical music, these two are very different things. As a classical music composer, I want to introduce 'the dark side of the classical music'...

The most of the people believe that classical music to be calming and relaxing, but it's a little wrong called.

# Second Viennese School & The Others

{: .text-justify}
[Arnold_Schoenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg) is the key name for atonality. He was a composer, teacher and painter. Arnold Schoenberg also the developer of better-known 12-tone-technique, which is ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note through the use of tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes \[1\]. Meaning that, this 12-tone -which makes up the chromatic scale- is organized in a way that avoids particular tonal associations and of course provides the composer with the possibilities of use they want later on. 12-tone-technique became associated with the "Second Viennese School" composers, who were the primary users of the technique in the first decades of its existence.

Second Viennese School is a group of composers, includes Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, Anton Webern. Those 3 composer are known as the milestone of the atonal music. As I introduced Arnold Schoenberg, he taught between 1903 and 1925. Alban Berg studied with Schoenberg for six years in the first decade of the 20th Century, and seemed to take a lot from his experiences. Gently tweaking Schoenberg's 12-tone brand of serialism by developing an entire piece from just one four-note idea. And, Anton Webern was also influenced by the great Schoenberg, and extended his 12-tone serialism into something that would later be called 'total serialism'. Webern's music was especially stripped-back and precise, often requiring some strange techniques on the part of the performer. Most of all, though, Webern was responsible for influencing the next generation of serialists.

12-tone-technique also used by Igor Stravinsky (my favorite), Béla Bartók, Krzysztof Penderecki etc. The most of the composers after 1950 influenced by 12-tone-technique and Schoenberg, Webern, Berg.

Béla Bartók's The Miraculous Mandarin, Igor Stravinsky's Le Sacre du printemps, Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima are good examples for chromaticism and atonality. Also Dmitri Shostakovich, Russian composer, was prone to use chromatic scales. His pieces are not completely atonal, but at the same time he often really abuses the key that he's in. The main difference between chromaticism and atonality is when you decide to use chromatic scales, you use a scale consisting of all 12 tones without actively trying to make it sound atonal; on the other hand, when you decide to use atonality, you use a scale consisting of all 12 tones, but with active avoidance of tonality.
