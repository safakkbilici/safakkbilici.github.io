# Introduction

{: .text-justify}
&nbsp; &nbsp; This post includes personal opinions on classical music, atonality & tonality, composition. Also includes formal informations about atonality theory and its history. Before starting to read, I strongly recommend you listen the most beautiful composition of Stravinsky: [Le Sacre du printemps](https://open.spotify.com/album/317b74rpNBO2uhaJFyMaxJ?si=Qm8WFADFRb6y6Ireoo24VQ). Leaving aside its historical development, atonality first manifested itself in the form of music in the early 1900s. I have described the lack of tanl music in my [Free Jazz post](https://safakkbilici.github.io/int-to-free-jazz/). But, free jazz and classical music, these two are very different things. As a classical music composer, I want to introduce 'the dark side of the classical music'...

The most of the people believe that classical music to be calming and relaxing, but it's a little wrong called.
