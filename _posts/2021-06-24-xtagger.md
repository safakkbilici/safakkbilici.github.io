x-tagger is a Natural Language Processing library for token classification (POS Tagging etc.). The reason why I called "in its simplest form" is the highest abstraction of it. You can train models and make inference in 5-10 lines of code. Other powerful feature of x-tagger is that it support most common dataset types. What does it mean? For example, [torchtext](https://pytorch.org/text/stable/index.html) is a common library for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for Natural Language Processing. Or, it is easy to train [huggingface transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) models with [huggingface datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/#).

x-tagger packs all of these powerful features together. To train a x-tagger model, you need a **most simplest form** of a POS tagging dataset. In this post, I call it as "x-tagger dataset" but it is nothing but list of tuple lists:

```
[
[('It', 'PRON'), ('was', 'VERB'), ('outrageous', 'ADJ'), ('.', '.')],

[('``', '.'), ('Both', 'DET'), ('sides', 'NOUN'), ('are', 'VERB'), 
 ('taking', 'VERB'), ('action', 'NOUN'), ('.', '.'), ("''", '.')],
...
]
```
